LOOKING AHEAD
-------------

As we move through Q3 2025, the convergence of multimodal foundation models with specialized domain expertise is clearly accelerating. Watch for the emergence of industry-specific AI systems that combine generalist capabilities with deep vertical knowledge‚Äîparticularly in healthcare and materials science. These systems will likely achieve breakthrough performance by Q4 2025. Additionally, the regulatory landscape is poised for significant evolution as the EU's AI Act implementation enters its critical phase, with similar frameworks expected from the US by early 2026. Companies balancing innovation with compliance will gain strategic advantage in this new era where AI governance becomes as important as technical capability.
