[DOTResize: Reducing LLM Width via Discrete Optimal Transport-based Neuron Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04517v1?utm_source=agent-k&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=llm-daily-july-12-2025) (2025-07-06)

Authors: Neha Verma, Kenton Murray, Kevin Duh Institution(s): Johns Hopkins University

This paper addresses a critical challenge in LLM deployment by introducing a novel approach to model compression that targets width reduction rather than depth reduction. DOTResize frames neuron compression as a discrete optimal transport problem, intelligently merging similar neurons to reduce model width while preserving performance. This approach is particularly significant as it provides a mathematical framework for identifying and eliminating redundancy in large language models without requiring retraining.

The authors demonstrate that their method can reduce the width of LLM layers by up to 50% with minimal performance degradation across various benchmarks. By focusing on width reduction, DOTResize complements existing pruning and quantization techniques, potentially enabling more efficient deployment of large language models on resource-constrained devices.

LOOKING AHEAD
-------------

As we enter the second half of 2025, multimodal AI systems continue to blur the boundaries between specialized models. The integration of reasoning capabilities with real-time sensory input is accelerating, with several tech giants expected to release comprehensive "AI companions" by Q4 that can process and respond to visual, auditory, and tactile information simultaneously. Regulatory frameworks are struggling to keep pace, with the EU's AI Act amendments anticipated by year-end.

Looking to Q1 2026, we're tracking the emergence of "federated personalization" ‚Äì a paradigm where highly customized AI experiences operate without centralized data collection. This approach addresses growing privacy concerns while enabling deeper personalization. Meanwhile, energy consumption remains a critical challenge, with several promising neuromorphic computing solutions expected to move from lab to limited deployment by early next year.
