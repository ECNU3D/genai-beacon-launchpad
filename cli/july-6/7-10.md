LOOKING AHEAD
-------------

As we move deeper into Q3 2025, the convergence of multimodal LLMs with specialized hardware is accelerating development cycles beyond previous projections. The recent breakthroughs in sparse attention mechanisms are enabling context windows approaching 10 million tokens, while maintaining inference costs at sustainable levels. Watch for the first wave of truly autonomous AI research agents to emerge by early Q4, capable of designing and conducting novel experiments with minimal human oversight.

Meanwhile, the regulatory landscape continues to evolve rapidly. With the EU's AI Act now fully implemented and similar frameworks advancing in the US and Asia, we anticipate new compliance-focused AI tools will become essential infrastructure for organizations by Q1 2026. These developments will likely catalyze the next evolution of human-AI collaboration systems designed specifically for regulated industries.
