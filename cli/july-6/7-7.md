LOOKING AHEAD
-------------

As Q3 2025 progresses, we're seeing clear signals that multimodal AI systems are reaching new heights of integration with physical systems. The emerging "embodied intelligence" paradigm‚Äîwhere LLMs directly control robots and IoT devices without human intermediaries‚Äîis poised to reshape industries by Q4. Companies like Boston Dynamics and OpenAI's recently announced hardware division are leading this transition.

Meanwhile, the regulatory landscape continues evolving rapidly. The EU's AI Act Phase 2 implementation deadline approaches in October, while the US appears weeks away from finalizing its comprehensive AI regulatory framework. Organizations should prepare for stricter transparency requirements and mandatory risk assessments for high-capability models as these regulations solidify in the coming months.
