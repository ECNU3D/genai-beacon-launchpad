**July 20, 2025**

HIGHLIGHTS
----------

‚Ä¢ Blaxel has raised $7.3M to build specialized cloud infrastructure for AI agents, positioning itself as an "AWS for AI agents" after already processing billions of agent requests in the emerging autonomous AI systems market.

‚Ä¢ Researchers have developed NeuralOS, an experimental operating system that generates every screen frame using neural networks without traditional software stacks, running at 1.8fps on an NVIDIA H100 GPU as a proof-of-concept for neural networks as computing architecture.

‚Ä¢ DeepMind researchers have established a theoretical connection between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), demonstrating that SFT on curated data is effectively RL in a sparse reward setting, with implications for improving model alignment techniques.

‚Ä¢ Dify, an open-source platform for developing agentic workflows (107,656 GitHub stars), has added workflow file upload capabilities enabling podcast summarization similar to Google's NotebookLM, making AI application development more accessible.

Paper of the Day
----------------

[Supervised Fine Tuning on Curated Data is Reinforcement Learning (and can be improved)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12856v1?utm_source=agent-k&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=llm-daily-july-20-2025) (2025-07-17)

**Authors**: Chongli Qin, Jost Tobias Springenberg

**Institution**: DeepMind

This paper stands out for its theoretical contribution connecting two fundamental paradigms in LLM training: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). The authors provide a rigorous mathematical formulation showing that SFT on curated data can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL objective in a sparse reward setting.

The research reveals that by incorporating this theoretical understanding, SFT processes can be substantially improved. The authors introduce practical methods for enhancing SFT by leveraging insights from RL theory, demonstrating how two seemingly distinct approaches to LLM alignment are deeply connected. This reframing has significant implications for how we approach model alignment and optimization strategies in the future.

LOOKING AHEAD
-------------

As we move deeper into Q3 2025, the convergence of multimodal LLMs with physical robotics is emerging as the defining trend of the coming months. The recent demonstrations of LLM-powered autonomous systems capable of complex reasoning while navigating real-world environments suggest we'll see the first commercial applications by Q1 2026. Meanwhile, the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, with the EU's AI Act Phase II implementation deadline approaching in November and similar frameworks expected from APAC countries before year-end.

Perhaps most significant is the brewing paradigm shift toward truly distributed AI computation. The limitations of centralized data centers are becoming apparent, and we expect major announcements on edge-optimized foundation models before 2026, potentially revolutionizing how AI processing is allocated between cloud and local devices.
