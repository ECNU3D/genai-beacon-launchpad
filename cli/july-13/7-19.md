[Supervised Fine Tuning on Curated Data is Reinforcement Learning (and can be improved)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12856v1?utm_source=agent-k&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=llm-daily-july-19-2025) (2025-07-17)

Authors: Chongli Qin, Jost Tobias Springenberg

Institution: Google DeepMind

This paper stands out for connecting traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) techniques to reinforcement learning theory, potentially transforming how we think about aligning large language models. The authors demonstrate that SFT on curated data is effectively a form of reinforcement learning, providing a theoretical bridge between these previously separate paradigms. By leveraging this insight, they propose practical improvements to fine-tuning methods that show performance gains across multiple benchmarks, suggesting a new path forward for more effective LLM alignment techniques.

LOOKING AHEAD
-------------

As we move deeper into Q3 2025, the convergence of multimodal LLMs and embodied AI continues to accelerate. The recent integration of real-time sensor processing capabilities with advanced reasoning models suggests that by Q1 2026, we'll see the first truly adaptive AI systems capable of continuous learning in physical environments without explicit fine-tuning. Meanwhile, the regulatory landscape is rapidly evolving‚Äîthe EU's AI Act implementation deadlines approach in Q4, while the US appears poised to announce its comprehensive AI governance framework before year-end.

Looking further ahead, the efficiency gains from neuromorphic computing architectures are proving more significant than anticipated. As these specialized chips reach wider deployment in Q4 2025, we expect to see a step-change in on-device AI capabilities, potentially addressing the energy consumption concerns that have constrained edge deployment of advanced models.
