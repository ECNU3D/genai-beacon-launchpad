Paper of the Day

[Supervised Fine Tuning on Curated Data is Reinforcement Learning (and can be improved)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12856v1?utm_source=agent-k&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=llm-daily-july-18-2025) (2025-07-17)

**Authors:** Chongli Qin, Jost Tobias Springenberg

**Institution:** DeepMind

This paper is significant because it establishes a theoretical framework connecting supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs to reinforcement learning, revealing that the dominant paradigm for aligning LLMs is fundamentally an RL process. By clarifying that SFT maximizes a lower bound on the RL objective, the authors provide crucial insights that could reshape how we approach model alignment.

The research shows that viewing SFT through an RL lens enables the development of improved algorithms that outperform standard SFT in both simulation and real-world LLM applications. The authors propose novel regularization techniques and demonstrate that established RL methods can be effectively applied to enhance fine-tuning, potentially offering a more principled approach to LLM alignment than current practices.

LOOKING AHEAD
-------------

As we move deeper into Q3 2025, the AI landscape continues its rapid evolution toward more personalized and context-aware systems. The emerging multi-modal LLMs with enhanced reasoning capabilities are poised to transform knowledge work by Q4, with early adopters already reporting 40-60% productivity gains. The regulatory framework taking shape in the EU and Asia will likely catalyze similar comprehensive legislation in the US before year's end.

Looking toward Q1 2026, we anticipate breakthrough developments in energy-efficient AI deployment as new specialized hardware hits the market. This, combined with decentralized training approaches, should address both the environmental concerns and computational bottlenecks that have limited broader AI integration. Organizations that adapt their workflows now will be best positioned to leverage these capabilities when they arrive.
